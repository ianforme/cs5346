People 
======

To the general populance, living with COVID has mostly became the new normal. People in Singapore and around the world has mostly complied with all of the restrictions put in place by the government (see the page on government) to minimize the impact of COVID. Yet, most people would still want to gain back some freedoms from pre-COVID, such as being able to travel to other countries without the risk of infection. As such, the following visualizations would answer some potential queries that people would have, and give people some hope for more freedom in the future.

Vaccination rate across countries
---------------------------------

This line chart shows the percentage of people that has been fully vaccinated across various countries. Only countries that has a non-zero percentage have been plotted. Full vaccination is defined by whether a person has received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol, thus a person receiving the first dose of a 2-dose vaccine would not be counted. The legend is sorted by the percentage of full vaccination as of the latest date (2021-03-19).

From this chart, we can see that Gibraltar and Israel has achieved a full vaccination percentage of more than 50%. A huge majority of the countries are still at below 5%. By zooming into the 0-5% range, we can see that the rate of vaccination of countries in the EU are fairly clustered, which bodes well for free travel within the EU again the in the future. Based on the rate of vaccination of the countries between the 3-5% range, it may take about a year for these countries to have about 50% of the population fully vaccinated, though with an increasing rate of vacciation, it may take even less time.

For Singapore, the full vaccination percentage as of now is about 4.16%. The rate of vaccination seems to be slowly decreasing, which could be explained by the policy of only vaccinating essential frontline workers first. With the import of the Moderna vaccines and the opening of vaccination to more of the populance, we would hope to see the rate of vaccination increase again.
